            <h2>Resources</h2>
            <p>The <a href="https://gpia-gis.github.io/adv-materials-spring2019/">class page</a> has many Glitch sites that are examples of doing various tasks with Carto and JavaScript. Let me know if you are trying to do something with JavaScript that is not listed there. There is also a <a class="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hXvyk_w5Ck&amp;feature=youtu.be">video where I talk through using a dropdown with Carto.js</a>.</p>
            <p>I recommend that you work through a bit more of the JavaScript resources I outlined in Assignment 7:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">Khan Academy</a> (online interactive course)</li>

            <h2>Continue working with JavaScript</h2>
            <p>There are numerous directions to go with JavaScript from this point. Pick <strong>one</strong> of the following activities based on which sounds most interesting or useful to you. Each of these assumes you are loading a Carto map using HTML and JavaScript. You could continue with the page and map you have been using for the past few assignments, start a new one, or work on one that is more relevant to your project.</p>
            <p>Your choices are:</p>
            <h3>(A) Add another layer to your map</h3>
            <p>Modify the map that you have made in JavaScript to have two or more layers. You can use <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/carto-two-layers">this Glitch site</a> as an example to work from.</p>
            <h3>(B) Filter data</h3>
            <p>Filter the data displayed on the map using SQL. Choose one or a few form inputs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>buttons (<code>&lt;button&gt;</code>) (<a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/carto-buttons">Glitch example</a>)</li>
                <li>checkboxes (<code>&lt;input type="checkbox" /&gt;</code>) (<a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/carto-checkboxes">Glitch example</a>)</li>
                <li>text inputs (<code>&lt;input type="text" /&gt;</code>) (<a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/carto-text-input">Glitch example</a>)</li>
                <li>dropdowns (<code>&lt;select&gt;</code>) (<a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/carto-dropdown">Glitch example</a>)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When the user changes the input(s), your page should filter the data on your map. <a href="http://htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/forms/">This HTML Dog page</a> gets into specifics of many HTML form elements.</p>
            <h3>(C) Add popups</h3>
            <p>Use JavaScript to create popups for your map that show the feature's data. Remember that one benefit of using JavaScript is you can embed videos and fully control the styles on your popups, so try to take advantage of that. Here's a <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/carto-popups">Glitch example</a>.</p>
